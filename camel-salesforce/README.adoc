= Camel with Salesforce Integration

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

== Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

    ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev


> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

== Salesforce

=== Create a Connected App 

Access and login in the https://developer.salesforce.com/signup[Salesforce Developer].
After login you will be directed to your custom salesforce tenant (with a different URL).

Access the following page, changing your tenant url: 

https://your-salesforce-url/lightning/setup/NavigationMenus/home

And access `New Connected App` button.

In the page of your recently created app, access `Oauth Credentials` button and take note of your Consumer Key, and Consume Secret.

Now it's time to authorize your application, remember to change the variables `salesforce-tenant-url` and `client-id` for your own values. Remembering that the client-id parameter is your `Consumer Key`.

https://<salesforce-tenant-url>/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=<client-id>&redirect_uri=https://<salesforce-tenant-url>/services/oauth2/success&display=touch

You will be redirect to a authorization page, give the authorization. 
After you will be redirected again to a URL, copy it and take the refresh_token parameter from it.

=== Application Setup

Now that you already know the consumer-key, consumer-secret and refresh-token, ajust the `application.properties` file with the correct values.

Let's generate the Salesforce DTO object from Lead

    mvn org.apache.camel.maven:camel-salesforce-maven-plugin:generate \
    -DcamelSalesforce.clientId=<your-consumer-key> \
    -DcamelSalesforce.clientSecret=<your-consume-secret> \
    -DcamelSalesforce.userName=<your-username-same-that-appears-when-you-did-the-authorize-step> \
    -DcamelSalesforce.password=<user-password> \
    -DcamelSalesforce.includePattern=Lead

Adjust all the values in the `application.properties` file.
